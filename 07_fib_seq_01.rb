# A slightly different kind of challenge this morning.

# The Company has broken the keyboard on their one and only laptop, so canâ€™t get this bit of code to run. What would the output of this code be (without running it on your own computer)? 

#  def fib(num_
#   if num < 2
#      num
#   else
#      fib(num-1) + fib(num-2)
#   end
# end
# puts fib(4)

# The code would out put an syntax error on line 5. The intrepeter would spit a message something along thsese lines "Error line 5, expected ) instead got _ "
